    <h2>About Haapsalu</h2>

    <p>You know very little of Haapsalu? No worries. Let us tell you about it.</p>

    <p>Haapsalu is a small coastal town with ten thousand inhabitants and it holds a very dear
      spot in our hearts. Haapsalu has been also loved by tzars, composers, artists and Finnish tourists.</p>

    <p>Haapsalu is well-known for us having a wedding there and it is older than Stars Hollow –
      founded in year 1279. It is famous for it’s mud treatment resorts and cute old town with wooden houses and cafes.</p>

    <p>At <em>THE</em> Day we will meet at Laikmaa Pavillion. The pavillion was built to honour the
    memory of Ants Laikmaa, a local artist who did great deeds in the early 20th century in the Estonian
    art field. For the German connection – Ants studied drawing in Düsseldorf.
    On the seaside promenade stands Kuursaal, where you will eat, drink and dance with us on our very
    special day, it is also one of the finest wooden buildings in Estonia.</p>

    <p>You will see Haapsalu in its summer bloom when it is packed with vacationers. During summer
      the town is full of life – almost every weekend there is some festival taking place, to name a few:
      Tschaikovsky Festival, Yoga Festival, August Blues and White Lady Time. Fun fact – even on our
      weekend there will be a festival – this time about accordion music.</p>

    <p>We can’t go without mentioning Haapsalu Railway Station, which has a unique covered
      platform that is 213.6m long and it is just across the street from our future home.</p>
