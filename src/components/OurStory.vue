    <h2>Our story</h2>

    <p>We are sho cute together! We sing Curly Strings together! And a song
      what starts with “Hallo-hey!” In case you wondered – we do have a sushibazooka!
      It is true! We have travelled Saaremaa, Bratislava, Iceland, Riga, Berlin,
      Venice, Lisbon, Malta (it is a tiny island) together and once Epp dragged Julian
      to a basket-making workshop in Oidrema. And Julian still believes that Epp forgot
      her drivers license for Iceland on purpose. We now have a bookshelf! And a
      greenhouse since last year. One time, we had more than 80 tomato plants and
      24 little tomatoes! We spend our free time making illustrations and vegan cheese;
      guess who does what… We haven’t given up on teaching our respective language
      to each other. Aga see on vaga raske. Eichhörnchen!? We bake together, and
      then we break together – the bread or Swedish cardamom buns or pizza rolls.
      Like companions. And every once in a while we go to a park or a café and read
      and peak at each other from behind the books. You see – we are sho cute together!</p>
